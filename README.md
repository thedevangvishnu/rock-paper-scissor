This repo is part of my project work of The Odin Project Foundation's for JavaScript.

Objective:

To code "Rock, Paper, Scissor" using JavaScript.

Currently, the objective is to code this game and 
play it using devtools console. Later a GUI will be added
to improve the overall experience of this game.
